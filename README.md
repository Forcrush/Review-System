# Review-System
Anonymous Review System based on Block-Chain(Rudimentary Version)


Background :

  Almost every research academic is aware of the current environment in which both institutions and individuals are subject to some form of assessment and a considerable proportion of the scoring is often weighted on the production of scholarly outputs, typically as papers in reputable journals. 
  
  Apart from the obvious authors and readers, these journals typically have a small number of editors who do most of the day-to-day management of the intellectual material; there might also be a larger editorial pool from the discipline who oversee the journal, and then there are those people who take on the role of reviewers which could include all of the previously listed groups of people.
  
  The production of a journal also include publishers who publish for profit or publish through a non-profit entity such as a learned society. Irrespective of the details of the process, the production of an academic journal is an economic system and like any such system the publishing process presents a number of intended and unintended incentives.
  Due to the anonymous nature of peer review, people seem to have lesser incentive to carry out this part of the publication process. Although some journals will list those that have carried out reviews on its behalf, it is more difficult to provide a measure of the number, quality and timeliness of those reviews. The paper considers how it might be possible to provide a greater incentive to carry out peer review and to raise the quality of those reviews using some of the currently available internet-based technologies. The proposal also provides a mechanism to track the review process and has the potential for wider application within the academic publishing environment as an alternative metric to those used at present.
